# Simple PLAN Implementation in C

This is a simple, naive implementation of PLAN in C.  This is basically
a port of `PLAN_SPEC.txt`.

TODO: This implements the previous version of PLAN, which doesn't support
recursive let-bindings.  This should work correctly on a lot of code,
but will break with some code that uses multiple let bindings.
