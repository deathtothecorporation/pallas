## Introduction

#todo brief explanation of what Pallas is, what Sire is
- automatic persistence
- portability, zero dependencies
- running program serialization

Maybe:
- macros
- continuations
- content-based addressing

#todo previous content:

> [Vaporware](https://vaporware.network) is a distributed operating system designed for use by individual people, not corporations. It is our belief that a personal internet, composed of computers entirely owned by normal people, is both possible and desirable. Our project owes its existence to the Urbit community—both for inspiration and support—but shares none of Urbit’s codebase and diverges from many of the principles and technical choices of the Urbit project.

> Vaporware runs on the Plunder virtual machine. [Plunder is a solid-state interpreter](https://git.sr.ht/\~plan/plunder): a programming environment which combines orthogonal persistence, functional programming, and homoiconicity. Imagine a Scheme Lisp machine with automatically persisted application state, and you’re not far off the mark. Plunder and Vaporware are not the same project, but share some of the same long term goals; Vaporware is the first third-party developer to adopt the Plunder software stack.

## Caveats

#todo current experimental nature of the repo, what's ready, what's not, etc.

## Installation

#todo brief installation instructions here for linux, mac. Should be
copy-pasteable and _just work_ for the majority of cases

#todo link out to [docs install page](https://vaporware.gitbook.io/vaporware/installation/installation) for more.

#todo improve the docs install page

## Getting Started

#todo command-line examples for:
- getting a REPL
- booting the TODO app, updating state, closing, re-launching to see state.

## Example

#todo some Sire examples

#todo link to examples directory

## Contributing

#todo the contributions we're interested in:
- Bugs in existing demos
- New demos
- Documentation improvements
- New Issue for “How does xyz thing work?” - with the satisfaction of the Issue being a PR to docs, examples, source code, etc.

#todo link to a `contributing.md`
