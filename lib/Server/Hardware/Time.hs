    TODO: Add profile tracing the the worker threads.

    This is the timer hardware.  The interface is simple:

        when :: IO Time       -- Get the current time
        wait :: Time -> IO () -- Block until the given time as passed.

    Implementation
    ==============

    WHEN Requests
    -------------

    We maintain a pool of all active WHEN requests (with ids).

    New WHEN requests are simply just added to the pool, on cancel we
    do nothing.

    There is a worker thread that processes WHEN requests.  If there
    are no WHEN, requests we block.  Otherwise, we fill all WHEN requests
    with the current time.

    WAIT Requests
    -------------

    We maintain a pool of all active WAIT requests (with ids).

    We also maintain an heap mapping timestamps to their request ids.

    New WAIT requests are added to the pool, and to the heap.  Canceling
    them just removes them from the pool.  We don't bother to remove
    them from the heap.

    There is a worker thread that processes WAIT requests.  It runs
    another (trivial) "alarm" thread and just sleeps until a certain
    time and then sets a flag.

    The WAIT worker looks at:

    -   What is the WHEN request with the earliest time?
    -   Is there an active alarm?

        -   If so, what time is it set for?
        -   If so, has it woken up yet?

    And applies the following logic:

    -   If there are no alarms and no WHEN requests, retry

    -   If the most recent WHEN matches the timer, but the timer hasn't
        fired, retry.

    -   When there is a timer but no WHEN:

        -   Cancel the timer

    -   If there is a WHEN but no timer:

      -   Launch a new timer

    -   When the most recent WHEN does not match the alarm:

        -   Cancel the timer
        -   Launch a new timer
        -   Update the timer state
